# Reader

The reader is key for measuring sleep and sleep cycles. 

We want to study our sleep patterns to deliver more effective audio prompts to align with REM sleep(dream sleep). 

**Current Reader:** Fitbit Versa 2

### How readers read:

- accelerometer: measures your movement during sleep
- skin temperature
- heart rate
- heart rate variation (REM is typically more variable)
- Circadian rhythm information and generic sleep patterns - i.e. Deep sleep is more prevalent during early hours of sleep etc.
