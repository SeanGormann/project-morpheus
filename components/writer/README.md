More specific documentation on specific devices and code interfaces.


What I've looked at so far:

- [Sleeppals Micro Sleep Buds](https://www.amazon.com/Sleep-Earbuds-Bluetooth-Headphones-Reduction/dp/B0DF7QFDG9/ref=sr_1_15?crid=25J9X8ATNVUVH&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.SRVpPMjwWwBoGMQEgd-c_98U5-i8Gggx1XiucBG2yxvQS3set1ZagP_7k83Y1I3iHxpylD9kX1COzxBHpku8wmql-eRsaN2YnsuVZgTFTT6p1qdq9hW8G-yH2N7X8WDNAvqpddWD5rb1lbUkyxPljbBNpr9dolJ181nX1MEiO_mNaCjOcJM2I13iYWyb2VQjSnxxwlUDzA0sO1FlOF4F-mXD1whcgwVcNVS4ck8w-dM.5GGGa-EjQRI1bvVQBYYQGOcTUENNQ1-pVaMckTrIMb0&dib_tag=se&keywords=soundcore%2BA20%2Bearbuds&qid=1745950822&sprefix=soundcore%2Ba20earbuds%2Caps%2C295&sr=8-15&th=1): Look just as comfortable as sleepcore ones and a third of the price.

- [Perytong Sleep Headband](https://www.amazon.com/Sleeping-Headphones-Bluetooth-Perytong-Headbands/dp/B0D31L1M5G/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?crid=122SDQDOJTNZQ&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.-76ghpb4BaRnHnudb3ljHGoK8fNwU-sQEaFC2Zbr1mO2OfO5qH_o_NFUp4VRj6dgDX4ptXN_9xT_3rZKTLX69maoxezKSHdJsoBwmixiu3uOeXATVLpVf0naTxiYm5pEYir2Hu3VRaozf3dN71kpGofH5Mei6vjqv6MaceOawzvqq3lxMGcyY8g79VkuZL-mqNN77nGQre-dW3T78PtaZ7Z20zhoECIVyFH_3FGdopM.HtHhdXKDsDKdbD0Xv6Q7Bsi-j4KsWgFKtQILV_PWk9Y&dib_tag=se&keywords=perytong%2Bsleep%2Bheadphones&qid=1745950759&sprefix=perytong%2Bsleep%2Bheadphones%2Caps%2C326&sr=8-1-spons&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&th=1): Also dirt cheap and may just be genuinely more comftorable, also a far lower rick of it falling off during the night.


Both of the above are cheap and present two different methods of using sound during sleeping. They should both be connectable to a desktop/laptop via bluetooth. 

# But why use audio to influence brain activity?
It's not fucking electrocuting your brain for one. There's evidence to support it works too:

## 40 Hz Auditory Stimulation and Brain Entrainment

### 1. Auditory Steady-State Responses (ASSRs)
- Amplitude-modulated white-noise and click-train stimuli at 40 Hz reliably evoke an auditory steady-state response, reflecting phase-locked gamma-band activity across widespread cortical networks. Source localization and EEG topographies show the strongest power increases over frontal and prefrontal electrodes corresponding to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) when participants listen with eyes closed to sinusoidal 40 Hz stimulation [Han et al. (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11571-022-09834-x).  

### 2. 40 Hz Binaural Beats
- Listening to binaural beats with a 40 Hz difference tone induces robust frequency-following responses in EEG, with significant power increases in the gamma band over fronto-central regions. These neural changes correlate with improved working memory performance and modulations of emotional state after 15–30 minutes of exposure [Jirakittayakorn & Wongsawat (2017)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28739482/).  

### 3. Systematic Review of Binaural-Beat Entrainment
- A recent systematic review of 14 EEG/MEG studies finds mixed evidence for true brainwave entrainment by binaural beats. While some report time-locked gamma ASSRs, methodological heterogeneity (stimulus parameters, analysis methods, sample characteristics) limits definitive conclusions about reliable gamma entrainment via binaural beats [Ingendoh et al. (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0286023). This will be important to dig into to refine our choices and check limitations.

## Transcranial Stimulation buisness

### 1. Direct DLPFC Modulation via 40 Hz tACS
- Concurrent 40 Hz transcranial alternating-current stimulation (tACS) applied over bilateral DLPFC increases BOLD activity locally in the stimulated DLPFC and remotely in premotor and anterior cingulate cortices, demonstrating causal engagement of frontal executive networks at gamma frequency [Helfrich et al. (2022)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35880231/).
